== Installation ==


= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don't even need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install, log in to your WordPress admin panel, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type "WP Event Manager" and click Search Plugins. Once you've found the plugin you can view details about it such as the the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by clicking _Install Now_.


= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading the plugin and uploading it to your web server via your favorite FTP application.

* Download the plugin file to your computer and unzip it

* Using an FTP program, or your hosting control panel, upload the unzipped plugin folder to your WordPress installation's `wp-content/plugins/` directory.

* Activate the plugin from the Plugins menu within the WordPress admin.


= Getting started =

Once installed:

**Note when using shortcodes**, if the content looks blown up/spaced out/poorly styled, edit your page and above the visual editor click on the 'text' tab. Then remove any 'pre' or 'code' tags wrapping your shortcode.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I setup WP Event Manager? =

View the getting [installation](http://www.wp-eventmanager.com/plugins-documentation/wp-event-manager/installation/) and [setup](http://www.wp-eventmanager.com/plugins-documentation/wp-event-manager/setting-up-wp-event-manager/) guide for advice getting started with the plugin. In most cases it's just a case of adding some shortcodes to your pages!


= Can I use WP Event Manager without frontend event submission? =

Yes! If you don't setup the [submit_event_form] shortcode, you can just post from the admin backend.


= How can I customize the event submission form? =

There are three ways to customize the fields in WP Event Manager;


1. For simple text changes, using a localisation file or a plugin such as [Say What](https://wordpress.org/plugins/say-what/).

2. For field changes, or adding new fields, using functions/filters inside your theme's functions.php file: [Read more](http://www.wp-eventmanager.com/plugins-documentation/wp-event-manager/editing-event-submission-form-fields/).

3. Use a 3rd party plugin which has a UI for field editing.
